Changes to invoke.js:
	Added the feature of passing funciton arguments from the command line using 
	the format: 
	
	node invoke.js <function> <function param 1> ... <function param n>

	Arguments from argv were packed into an array and that array is passed to 
	contract.submitTransaction().

	This alows for all functions to be called form the terminal without having to 
	edit invoke.js to use a different function than was used previously.

Cahnges to query.js;
	Added the feature of passing funciton arguments from the command line using 
	the format:

	node query.js <optional car ID num>

	If the car ID field is left blank, contract.evaluateTransaction('queryAllCars')
	is executed.
	If a car ID is passed (decimal number), it is concatenated with "CAR" to create
	a valid world state query key; passing a decimal number executes 
	contract.evaluateTransaction('queryCar', 'CAR#') 
	where # is the terminal arguemnt passed.
